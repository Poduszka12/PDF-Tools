Program Overview

This program allows you to replace product codes with clickable product links in PDF files, such as technical drawings. Here's how it works:

Manufacturer Information

  The program extracts the manufacturer's name from the folder name that contains your PDF files.
  It also reads the product codes listed within those PDF files.

CSV File Setup

  You need to provide a CSV file with the following information:
    1. Manufacturer Name: Enter the name of the manufacturer in the "name" column.
    2. Manufacturer Codes: Enter the product codes provided by the manufacturer (as shown on their technical drawings) in the "Symbol" column.
    3. Your Store Codes: Enter the corresponding product codes used in your store in the "Symbol_1" column.
Adding Links

  The program uses the CSV file to match the manufacturer’s codes with your store’s codes.
  It then replaces the product codes in the PDF with links to the corresponding products in your store.

Steps to Use the Program:

  1. Organize Your Files
    Place all relevant PDF files in a folder named after the manufacturer.

  2. Prepare the CSV File
    Create a CSV file with three columns: name, Symbol, and Symbol_1.
    Fill in the manufacturer’s name, their product codes, and your store’s product codes accordingly.

  3. Run the Program
    Load the PDF files and the CSV file into the program.
    The program will automatically replace the product codes in the PDFs with the appropriate links.

This tool streamlines the process of linking products in your technical documents, making it easier for users to access product information directly from the PDFs.
